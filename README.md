# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: 

In this project, we are asked to analyze the Amazon reviews paid by Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. We will have access to approximately 50 datasets in this project. The company is analyzing the possibility of joining the Amazon Vine Program. Amazon Vine invites customers to receive a product for free in exchange for a review. 

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help the team in Amazon decide whether joining Amazon paid review will generate a positive return on investment.

Results: 

o	How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

there are total of 72587 reviews, which 64968 is non-vine reviews and 613 vine reviews.

o	How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

30543 reviews was non_vine reviews and 222 was vine reviews

o	What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

36% of percentage was the vine reviews and 47% was vine non reviews in 5 stars votes.

Summary: 

By looking at the data we see that there is more reviews on non paid Vine reviews and the percentage of the non paid Vine reviews are higher than Vine reviews, then we can can coclude that there is bias specially for this outcome.

It would be a good recomendation to check the data for 4 stars as well and 5 star , so maybe we can have more acurate result.
